# PacketSnifferDemonstration
This was a project aimed at demonstrating how to use a packet sniffer called Wireshark.

The first section highlights the basic tools of how to operate wireshark and start capture packets exchanged over a network. The goals were, identifying key elements such as IP, recognizing HTTP get requests, identifying TCP packets, tracing origins of packets, and understanding the Wireshark UI.
The second section displays the use of TCP and DNS filtering to capture only TCP and DNS.
The third section dives into TCP protocols and displays the understanding of a 3-way open and 4-way close.
The last section highlights the identification and understanding of how DHCP works.
